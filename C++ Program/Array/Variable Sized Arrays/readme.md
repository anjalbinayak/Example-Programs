Consider an n-element array,a , where each index i in the array contains a reference to an array of k-i integers (where the value of  varies from array to array). See the Explanation section below for a diagram.

Given a, you must answer q queries. Each query is in the format i j, where  denotes an index in array a and j denotes an index in the array located at a[i]. For each query, find and print the value of element j in the array at location a[i] on a new line.

Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of  (the number of variable-length arrays) and  (the number of queries).
Each line  of the  subsequent lines contains a space-separated sequence in the format k a[i]0 a[i]1 … a[i]k-1 describing the -element array located at .
Each of the  subsequent lines contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of  (an index in array ) and  (an index in the array referenced by ) for a query.

Constraints

All indices in this challenge are zero-based.
All the given numbers are non negative and are not greater than 
Output Format

For each pair of  and  values (i.e., for each query), print a single integer that denotes the element located at index  of the array referenced by . There should be a total of  lines of output.

We perform the following  queries:

Find the array located at index , which corresponds to . We must print the value at index  of this array which, as you can see, is .
